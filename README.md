# Project Navigator
Project Navigator, short as, ProjNav, is a simple tkinter app the opens a "Project Folder" in Windows Explorer on a "Project Number" input. 
A "Project Number" in this scenario is a string that starts with "CAB", "CON", "HSK" or "ITN", then follows by 4 or more digits. 

# Prerequisites
For the sake of convenience, the prerequisite directories have been hard coded just for personal use. 
This app will only work on Windows.
